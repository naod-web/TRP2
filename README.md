# Project Chimera

Production-grade, scalable system for running a fleet of Autonomous Influencer Agents.

## Structure
- **specs/**: Vision, functional, technical, and integration specs
- **skills/**: Reusable agent capabilities (see README.md in each skill)
- **src/**: Core code (orchestrator, swarm roles, memory, skills)
- **tests/**: Contract/interface tests

## Prime Directive
This is Project Chimera — autonomous influencers, MCP-first, swarm-governed, specs-driven. NEVER generate code without checking specs/ first.
